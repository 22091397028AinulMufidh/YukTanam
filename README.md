# About
Cultivating Sustainable Habits, One Step at a Time

**Backgrounder:**

Urbanization and busy lifestyles have led to a decline in eco-friendly habits, especially gardening, impacting both individual well-being and environmental health. Studies show that gardening can improve mental health, reduce stress, and support biodiversity, yet people struggle with maintaining plant care due to time constraints, lack of knowledge, and unsuitable plant choices. This project proposes YukTanam, a mobile gardening app, to help users build sustainable gardening habits by providing personalized plant recommendations, guided plant care with reminders, and a gamified system that tracks plant growth and health. Leveraging machine learning, the app identifies optimal plant options based on environmental data and user lifestyles while offering AI-based feedback for plant health through image recognition. We choose to tackle this problem as it aligns with global efforts toward environmental sustainability and individual well-being.
